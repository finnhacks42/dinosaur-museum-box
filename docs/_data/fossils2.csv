velociraptor_claw.png,Velociraptor claw,"velociraptor is a small carnivorous dinosaur. It was about the size of a turkey. Recently paleontologists have discovered that velociraptor was almost certainly featured. This is the ""killing claw"" - the second toe claw, that may have been used to hold struggling prey in a similar way to modern hawks.
