This was a lockdown project to create some fun dinosaur resources for primary schoolers.
The idea was triggered when a little parcel arrived from my wonderful Aunt with some (real) ammonite and Orthoceras fossils from her teaching days.
The kids were enthralled so we looked at photos of T-rex claws and Megalodon teeth. Then I discovered that some museums, private collectors and research organisations had very generously made 3d scans of their fossils available online for free, so I decided to make a mini-dinosaur museum in a box, that the kids could share with their classmates when they returned to school (since excursions and museums were off limits for the indefinate future).

## Making the dinosaur museum in a box
 I downloaded a selection of models that the children approved of (heavily weighted towards teeth and claws), cleaned the models up to make them 3d printable ([view/download models]({{ site.baseurl}}/replicas)) and printed them out on my consumer grade 3d printer (Flashforge Dreamer) at high resolution. To finish them, I sanded them down lightly, primed them with a grey plastic primer paint and then painted them with ordinary student acrylics. 

 To complement the real and replica fossils I added;

- Some realistic toy dinosaurs (from Safari Ltd).
- Books on dinos and fossil hunting.
- Some silicone moulds (using food safe silicon & the 3d printed models) so the kids could cast their own 'fossils'. 
- A timeline, showing the different epochs. [Download timeline]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/printable/timeline.pdf) (Print at A2 size to get 1cm = 1 Million years. I got it printed on Tyvek and it's held up well so far).
- Cards with some details on each fossil & toy. [Download cards]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/printable/cards.pdf).
- [Some activity ideas]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/printable/activity_ideas.pdf).

I had great fun making this project and it has been a hit with the kids too. A big thank you to all the organisations and people who shared the 3d data to make this possible.
